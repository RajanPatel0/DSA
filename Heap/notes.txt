Heap= It's a complete binary tree that comes with a heap order property

*CBT= all nodes level is completely filled except last leaf level
       or always moves from left to right

*Heap Order Property = two types (maxi, mini)

*max Heap= every node child has value less than parent
*min Heap= every child node has value more than parent (means parent node is less than child)

Implementation using array= [x,60,50,40,30, 20]

if:
Node= ith index
then:
left child= 2*ith index
right child= (2*i+1)th index

parent = (i/2)th index

*Insertion In Heap:
